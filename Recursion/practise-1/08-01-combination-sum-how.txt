This is how combination sum works
 In this problem we are going to write how many combinations 
 are present in a set where there are repetetion of elements 
 are there.

 Here first we are checking that elements are repeated or not. After
 we are counting them how many times they are repeated.
 
 Next we are keeping over slate only those many number of 
 elements whose sum is less than the target 

 Otherwise if we keep elements whose overall sum is greater than
 than the target then there is no use. 
 
 After that we are adding that value to slate and calling
 the subordinate to fill remaining elements of the slate

 Here we are not using include/exclude principle becuase this
 is not subsets whose sum equal to target. This is to find
 overall combination of elements whose sum is equal to target

 Hence only one subordinate we are calling to fill the remaining
 elements of the slate.

 After that handle base cases

 1st case: When the target value ==0 we got the result, add to slate
 2nd base case:  When the slate length equals to the length of array
 3rd base case: When the index value reaches the length of the target
