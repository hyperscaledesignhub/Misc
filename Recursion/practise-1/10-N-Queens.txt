Explaining the N Queens problem:
In a NXN chess board no 2 queens can attack each Other
We have to place N queens such that No  queens attack each other

Queens area of regime is:

1. complete row
2. Diagonal position
3. Complete coloumn

How the logic works:

slate list stores columns positions: 
slate[i] = coloumn_number

For ex:  [1,3,0,2] means queen at the position

(0,1) => first row and 1st coloumn
(1,3) => second row 3rd coloumn
(2,0) => second row 1st coloumn
The index of slate says the row value

1. Tries placing the a queen each coloumn of the 
current row

2. Only place if no conflict with existing queens

3. backtracks by removing the queen if the 
path doesn't works

Above is the main goal

How conflict is detected?

1. Coloumn check: Is another queen same coloumn?

2. Diagonal check: If row differences equal to the coloumns difference if 
they are in same diagonal 

3. base case:  When i == n, all queens are 
successfully placed

For ex: The program finds solution like this:
N=4

[1,3,0,2]  

What we are doing is for every col we are doing the following

We are checking  there is a conflicting queen already exists at the
the row starting from '0' to len(slate) 

For that we need to find 2 conditions:
1. If queen already exist in the slate at the given 'row' in the 
slate with condition slate[rowindex] == col, that means existing
'col' where we are doing the search for the queen is already present
in the state[rowindex]. 

2. Second condition is: queen at position (len(slate),col) where we
want to keep the queen and already exisitng queen at (rowindex,slate[rowindex]) 
check the rowdiff and coldiff, check both are same
rowdiff = abs(rowindex-len(slate)) and 
coldiff = abs(col-slate[rowindex]) 
both are same  

Second time i am writing

This is how nqueens works:

1. first we are working to place i th queen
2. for the i'th queen the position we are targetting to place 
is (len(slate),col). 
3. For this position we are checking whether any 
other queens are already present by checking the conflict
4. For the conflict function what we have we check the following
    1. for the given col where we want to place the i th queen,loop through
    all the rows from 0 to len(slate) and for each row check the following
        a. already any queen is present in the i'th row with the following check
         slate[rowindex] == col. If both are same that means already there is 
         a queen at the col.
         col check doesn't matter which row, because each col of queen covers
         complete vertical place. In that case we need rowindex for the slate?
         The reason is: we are searching in slate at a given rowindex any queen
         already placed in a same col. For that, ideally col doesn't depend 
         on the row. This check is going to cover all queens that are present so far
         anything is already matching the given col 
       b. Next we are checking for all existing queens which are referenced by the rowindex
       that whether any of the queen row col diff check is matching. row cal diff check is
       to ensure that there there is a diagonal match of any of the existing queens
       referred by travelling rowindex from 0 to len(slate) where existing queen
       is referred by (rowindex,slate[rowindex])  and new queen which we have to place
       is refrred by (len(slate),col) 
       rowdiff = abs(rwoindex - len(slate))
       coldiff = abs(col - slate[rowindex])
       if both are same then that means there is already queen exists diagonal position
       to the current queen at (len(slate),col)
