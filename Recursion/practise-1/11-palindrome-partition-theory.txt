In the palindrome partition our goal is what?
we have to find out all the possible ways that we can split the
string in such a way that we need to find all the palindromes

aabaa->
all single letters are palindromes:
['a','a','b','a','a']
['aa','b', 'aa'] are also palindromes
['a','aba','a'] are palindromes
['aabaa'] is also a palindrome

How we are doing?
As per the manager subordinate theory

I am responsible for i'th position of the string,
like from i'th position to len(str)

And i am adding to slate i'th, i-i+1; i-i+2;... upto i:len(str)
After adding a single number to slate, i am calling my subordinate
to add slate all palindromes starting from i+1'st position onwards
So i add i'th element to the slate and i call my subordinate 
to start from i+1. 
For ex:
take aabaa
I am starting from 0'th position:
added following to slate: [a], called subordinate
start from 1'st: Checked slate is palindrome 
in the begining and its added to result. slate
remaining same
[aa], Again this is added to result

This subordinate calls next, he adds aab, this is not palindrome
returned.. 
Then this subordinate removes from slate
adds  'a', but a is a palindrome then why its not 
added to result

See we add the result after i reaches to length of the string.
slate is not going to get added immediately after last slate value is a palindrome

See i am going to add the value that i have received from my manager 

in the begining, if last value that my manager added is not a palindrome 

i return back.  
If i value of my manager equal to lenght of the string then i add
