lets take input = 'ab'
we need to produce output having length 2 of each letter
Let's say each letter is length '3' then these letters
have to be placed in slate of size 3, how many combinations
are there:  C(3,2) = 3 
How this happen:
suppose digit=12
then first as an intermediate node i am going to do the following:

extract the letter corresponding to digit '1'-> 'abc'
now i go through each letter and keep each letter in a slate
And i call 3 subordinates for each letter starting with 'a', 'b' and 'c'
Each subordinate comes back by filling the remaing part of slate
with the remaining letters of the next digit

Let's take first subordinate who started with letter 'a' in slate

What my overall program is doing:

it is extracting a given digit at a given index and getting the
corresponding letters from it and adding to slate each letter
at the given index. 

For a moment don;t confuse the operation that is being done inside the helper
while calling the subordinate, 
 helper(slate+letter,i+1)
We can think of this operation as:
slate= slate+letter
nextIndex = i+1
helper(slate,nextIndex)
That means any node is doing this operation of adding to slate
and creating next index.

Then calling subordinate to take care the next steps
Hence next subordinate starts with 'a' and 
finish adding remaining elements of the next digit and comes back

that means it  extracts next digit '2' and keep adding the 
letters 'def' to the next position in slate and comeback helper
Similary next subordinate start with 'b' and add the next set of
elements of the digit '2' and comes back. similary next subordinate
starts with 'c' and adding next set of subordinates and comes back

This is how we can imagine this as recursive faith of truth
